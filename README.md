AI and Segmentation Model for PTB Evaluation

Welcome to our repository! 
Here, we provide the AI and segmentation models developed for evaluating the infectivity of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) using chest radiography. 
These models leverage cutting-edge deep learning technologies to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

About the Models
DenseNet121: Utilized for its robust feature extraction capabilities in analyzing chest X-rays.
TransUNet: Employed for precise lung region segmentation, focusing on the most relevant areas for PTB infectivity assessment.
